# TicTacToe

This is a college project from 2013 (1st semester) that I uploaded to share. The file names are still in Portuguese, sorry. They will be translated eventually.

The main part is an Arduino project. It's a game of Tic Tac Toe that can be played between human players or between a human player and the computer. The inputs are buttons and a potentiometer and the output is a 14 character LCD display. The computer player is a perfect player: it can win and draw, but it will never lose.

The `*.dsn` file describes the hardware. It requires Labcenter Proteus to be opened.

The `*.ino` file is the source code for Arduino. The `*.hex` file is the previous file compiled in order to run on the Proteus simulated Arduino.

The `*.svg` file is the perfect player logic.

There's also a NetBeans Java project that I created to test the logic, I think, but I'm not sure how to make it work anymore.
